# Medmedes
MedMedes is a simple Android application for monitoring blood glucose levels. Currently in development.

User first creates an account with a username and password. They are automatically taken to enter their first value, a Toast appears informing the user about the number entered (“Your glucose is abnormally low. Be careful”). The screen emphasizes an average from the month’s data, though users may select “Glucose History” to see past results, color coded green for healthy results and red for others. The user may also select “Medicine Reminders” to create an alarm for their medications.

Sizes, placement, and color are used to make the app easy to view for users. Green color and welcome message are used to make the application comfortable.

Uses Google Firebase in order to store and retrieve data.
